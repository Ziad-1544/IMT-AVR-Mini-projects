# AVR Mini Projects
## DIO,LED,SSD DRIVERS TASK
### Overview:
This project demonstrates the basic usage of the ATmega32 microcontroller for controlling an LED and displaying information on 7-segment display. <br>
It introduces the use of input switches, output LEDs, and LCDs for embedded systems.
### Project Files
-DIO Driver: Handles digital input/output operations for the microcontroller 'ATMEGA 32'.<br>
-SSD Driver: Manages the 7-segment display.<br>
-LED Driver: Controls the LED, including toggling.<br>
-Switch Driver: Detects and debounces the DIP switch input.<br>

## DIO_EXTRA_1
### Overview:
This project controls 8 LEDs using 8 DIP switches connected to an ATmega32 microcontroller. Each switch toggles a corresponding LED on or off, demonstrating basic digital input/output functionality in embedded systems.
### Project Files
DIO Driver: Digital Input/Output driver to manage the pins.<br>
LED Driver: Controls LED functionality.<br>
Switch Driver: Handles input from DIP switches.<br>

## DIO_EXTRA_2
### Overview:
This task implements a counter using two push buttons, allowing the user to increment or decrement a value displayed on a seven-segment display. The counter cycles between 0 and 9, resetting to 0 after reaching 9 and to 9 after reaching 0. This project showcases basic button interfacing and seven-segment display control in embedded systems.
